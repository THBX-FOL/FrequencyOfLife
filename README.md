# Frequency of Life  
  
Frequency of Life (FoL) is a music, wellness, and personalization platform that transforms user inputs into curated experiences (playlists, insights, and rituals) through a carefully designed system of interfaces, integrations, and user-centered flows.  
  
This repository is part of the **Frequency of Life open-source ecosystem**.    
It supports community-driven development while protecting the platform’s proprietary core algorithms.
